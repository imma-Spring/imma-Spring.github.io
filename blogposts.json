    "content": "Legends have always facinated me, from niche local stories, to nationwide stories that vary by region.\nI can still remeber sitting around in a circle at night, flashlights out telling stories that you sear are true or that your friend swears this happened.\nSome of those stories have really stuck with me and I still tell them to others if they ask.\n\nOk, so my neighborhood borders the woods and in there, there is a small trailer caravan abandoned on a slope. It's about the size of two bathroom stalls.\nWell, the story goes, that caravan was the dwellings of an older man, about 50-60. He lived there to hide from society, he didnt like people, especially if you got to close. Despite this, the man was fairly nice, would talk to some of the neighbor kids, but would keep to himself for the most part.\nBut when the sun would set and you couldnt tell shadow from the night he would leave the woods and wander, and any poor souls he would come across, he would murder them with a cheff knife, dragging their body into the woods, and no one would find them.\nEventually the kids saw him less and less, and it was rumored that he still lived in the woods. I still remember searching those woods with my friends, we never did find him, or if he was even real, but it always felt like there was something watching us in those woods, it was far too quite."
